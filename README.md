# King of the Board

Small project to keep track of board game scores between me and my friends.
Used it to learn some React and to get up to date on modern build tools, purposefully avoiding create-react-app in the end.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run bootstrap`

Creates the sqlite database from the provided schema.

### `npm run dev`

Launches the backend server in development mode. The server is restarted when backend files are edited and the webpack build is triggered when frontend files are changed.

### `npm run build`

Packages the app for production.
